👋 Hi, I’m Toralf Richter.

I work at the intersection of **live sports production, streaming technology and automation**.
My background combines hands-on event production with Linux-based infrastructure and open-source tooling.

**Focus areas**
- Live streaming (SRT, RTMP, WebRTC, HLS)
- Media servers (MediaMTX, FFmpeg, OBS, vMix)
- Monitoring & automation
- Linux, systemd, shell & Python, JavaScript

I enjoy building **pragmatic, low-cost solutions** for real-world production setups –
from Raspberry Pi to cloud servers.
